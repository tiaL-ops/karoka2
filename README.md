## Karoka

**Karoka** is a 2D game designed to teach coding while helping you discover how you learn best.

This version is the **first full-stack public release** I’ve ever built ( messy codebase alert!) .  I believe it’s still worth showcasing. It represents the early stages of Karoka where i believed to make it real first , perfection will catch later.
