## ðŸŽ® Karoka

**Karoka** is a 2D game designed to teach coding while helping you discover how you learn best.

This version is the **first full-stack public release** Iâ€™ve ever built, and while the codebase may be a bit messy, I believe itâ€™s still worth showcasing. It represents the early stages of Karoka and how it all started â€” raw, experimental, and full of learning.

## Note

The new codebase is definitely neater and more structured. But this version tells an important part of the story , where Karoka began. I hope it gives you a sense of the project's spirit, even in its earliest form.

Thanks for checking it out â€” and for being patient with the messier bits!
